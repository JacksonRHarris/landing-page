# landing-page
My landing page project done for the Odin Project curriculum. 
Introduction: The goal of this project is to use the skills I have developed with the Odin Project to build a landing page using HTML, CSS, and CSS Flexbox.
At the end of this project I will reflect on which skills I used in order to complete it.
